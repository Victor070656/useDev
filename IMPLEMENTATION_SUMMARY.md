---

## Configuration Requirements

### 1. Paystack Setup
Update [/includes/config.php](includes/config.php):
```php
define('PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY', 'pk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE');
define('PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY', 'sk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE');
define('PAYSTACK_MODE', 'live'); // Change to 'live' for production
```

### 2. Webhook Configuration
Set up webhook URL in Paystack Dashboard:
- URL: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/paystack.php`
- Events to subscribe:
  - `charge.success`
  - `transfer.success`
  - `transfer.failed`
  - `transfer.reversed`

### 3. Currency Conversion
Update exchange rate in [/includes/paystack_helper.php](includes/paystack_helper.php):
```php
// Line ~230
$exchangeRate = 1500; // Update with current USD to NGN rate
```

### 4. File Upload Directories
Ensure these directories exist and are writable:
```bash
chmod 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs/useDev2/uploads/profiles
chmod 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs/useDev2/uploads/portfolio
chmod 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs/useDev2/uploads/attachments
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Currency Conversion**: Currently uses fixed exchange rate. Consider integrating live exchange rate API for production.

2. **Bank Verification**: Only supports Nigerian banks via Paystack. For international creators, consider alternative payout methods.

3. **File Storage**: Files stored locally. For production at scale, consider:
   - Cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary)
   - CDN integration
   - Backup strategy

4. **Email Notifications**: Not implemented. Consider adding for:
   - Payment confirmations
   - Payout notifications
   - Milestone approvals

1. **Test all flows** in Paystack test mode
2. **Set up production Paystack keys** before going live
3. **Configure webhook URL** in Paystack dashboard
4. **Update currency conversion rates**
5. **Test file upload limits** and adjust if needed

### Medium Priority
1. **Implement email notifications**:
   - Payment confirmations
   - Payout notifications
   - Milestone updates

2. **Add review system** (from TODO list):
   - Client reviews for creators
   - Creator reviews for clients
   - Display on profiles

3. **Improve transaction filtering**:

### Lower Priority
1. **Cloud storage integration** for file uploads
2. **Live exchange rate API** integration
3. **Multi-currency support** (USD, EUR, GHS, ZAR)
