## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Bug: Undefined Variable in submit-proposal.php**
**File:** `/creator/submit-proposal.php`
**Line:** 70
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Problem:**
```php
// Line 70 - Variable $creatorProfileId used but never defined
$stmt->bind_param('ii', $briefId, $creatorProfileId);
```

**Impact:**
- All proposal submissions would FAIL with "Undefined variable" error
- Creators completely unable to submit proposals
- Database query would fail

**Fix:**
Added proper creator profile lookup before using the variable:
```php
// Get creator profile
$stmt = db_prepare("SELECT id FROM creator_profiles WHERE user_id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param('i', $creatorId);
$stmt->execute();
$creatorProfile = $stmt->get_result()->fetch_assoc();
$stmt->close();

if (!$creatorProfile) {
    set_flash('error', 'Creator profile not found. Please complete your profile first.');
    redirect('/creator/profile.php');
    exit;
}

$creatorProfileId = $creatorProfile['id'];
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 2. **Missing "Browse Projects" Link in Creator Navigation**
**File:** `/includes/sidebar.php`
**Lines:** 28-36

**Problem:**
Creator sidebar was missing the "Browse Projects" link, making it difficult for creators to discover new project briefs.

**Fix:**
Added "Browse Projects" link to creator navigation:
```php
$navLinks = [
    ['url' => '/creator/index.php', 'icon' => 'bx-grid-alt', 'label' => 'Dashboard', 'page' => 'index.php'],
    ['url' => '/creator/briefs.php', 'icon' => 'bx-search', 'label' => 'Browse Projects', 'page' => 'briefs.php'], // ADDED
    ['url' => '/creator/proposals.php', 'icon' => 'bx-file', 'label' => 'My Proposals', 'page' => 'proposals.php'],
    // ... other links
];
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 3. **Budget Input Formatting Issue**
**File:** `/creator/brief-detail.php`
**Line:** 237

**Problem:**
HTML5 number input validation wasn't working correctly due to improper formatting of min/max attributes.

**Before:**
```php
min="<?= $brief['budget_min'] / 100 ?>"
max="<?= $brief['budget_max'] / 100 ?>"
```
This would output: `min="5000"` instead of `min="5000.00"`

**After:**
```php
min="<?= number_format($brief['budget_min'] / 100, 2, '.', '') ?>"
max="<?= number_format($brief['budget_max'] / 100, 2, '.', '') ?>"
```
Now outputs: `min="5000.00"` (proper decimal format for HTML5 validation)

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

### 4. **Contact Client Link Missing URL Helper**
**File:** `/creator/brief-detail.php`
**Line:** 192

**Problem:**
Link was missing the `url()` helper function wrapper.

**Before:**
```php
<a href="/messages/inbox.php">
```

**After:**
```php
<a href="<?= url('/messages/inbox.php') ?>">
```

**Note:** Changed destination from `thread.php` to `inbox.php` as thread functionality requires additional implementation.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

## üîß Technical Details

### Budget Storage Format
- Budgets are stored in the database as **integers in cents**
- Example: `50000` in database = `$500.00` displayed
- Conversion: `$amount_in_dollars * 100 = cents`
- Display: `cents / 100 = dollars`

### Form Submission Flow
1. User fills proposal form modal
2. Form submits to `submit-proposal.php` via POST
3. CSRF token validated
4. Creator profile lookup (NOW FIXED)
5. Brief validation (exists, open status)
6. Duplicate proposal check
7. Budget range validation
8. Amount converted to cents: `(int)($amount * 100)`
9. Insert into `proposals` table
10. Activity logged
11. Success message & redirect

## üéØ Next Steps

### Recommended Testing
1. Test complete proposal submission workflow end-to-end
2. Verify all budget edge cases (min, max, out of range)
3. Test with different user accounts
4. Test error handling (invalid brief ID, duplicate proposals, etc.)

### Future Improvements
1. Add direct messaging functionality (creator to client)
2. Add proposal edit/withdraw functionality
3. Add file attachment support for proposals
4. Add proposal template feature
